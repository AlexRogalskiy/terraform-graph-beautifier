# terraform-graph-beautifier

Command line tool allowing to convert the barely usable output of the `terraform graph` command to more meaningful and explanatory diagrams.

It works by parsing the [Dot](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) script generated by `terraform graph` from the standard input (or file) and producing a cleaned and prettier Dot script on the standard output (or file).
The output can then piped to a [rendering command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dot).

## Graph loading and cleaning / filtering
The loading of the input graph involves several steps:
1. **Cleaning**
   1. Renaming the nodes using a more consistent pattern : `"[root] rsc_type.rsc_name"` => `"module.root.rsc_type.rsc_name"`.
   1. Using `'` instead of `"` in map keys : `buckets["artefacts"]` => `buckets['artefacts']`
   1. Removing the nodes and edges generated by Terraform but not corresponding to configuration elements (aka TF junk). This can be deactivated via a command line switch.
1. **Filtering**
   - Using user-provided pattern(s) to exclude some elements (resource, var, module, provider, ...) from the output.
   - These patterns are [Go regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) and are matched line by line against the output of the **cleaning** step, so use the `"root.rsc_type.rsc_name"` naming. 

## HTML output templating
The command uses Go [HTML templates](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) to create the Cytoscape.js HTML output.
These templates and all the command assets are embedded in the binary using [pkger](https://github.com/markbates/pkger).
The generated Go file is checked-in in order for the repository to be "go-gettable".

In development mode, when working on the templates for example, you don't want to launch this generation process every time you modify the asset files; instead you would prefer using the current version of these files.
To do this, simply configure your IDE to use the build tag `skippkger`.
